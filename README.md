### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Fernando and I'm a web developer based in CriciÃºma ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·.

In 2016, I've decided to change careers from International Affairs to IT. Since then, I've explored different aspects of software development, having worked for 2 years with Support and concluded my undergraduate studies in System Analysis and Development.

So far, I've worked with different stacks, such as Node/React, Java/Spring/Hibernate and Kotlin/Micronaut. Currently, I work as a full stack developer with Angular/Java.

After a long break, I'm reactivating this profile so I can share my studies.
