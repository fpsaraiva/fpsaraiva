### Hello GitHub World! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Fernando and I'm a fullstack web developer based in Porto Alegre ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·.

In 2016, I've decided to change careers from International Affairs to IT. Since then, I've explored different aspects of software development and worked for 2 years as a Support Engineer.

I've worked with different technologies, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Postgres and MySQL and I'm currently learning Node.js. I have a strong intererest in Agile methodologies too.
